# --- Route Tables for Database Subnets ---

# --- Corrected Private Route Table Associations ---
# If NAT Gateways are enabled, associate private subnets with their respective NAT Gateway route tables.
# If NAT Gateways are NOT enabled, private subnets will use the VPC's main route table implicitly,

# Note: The main route table of the VPC by default allows intra-VPC communication.
# We are creating specific route tables for each subnet type for more granular control.
# Ensure the main route table doesn't inadvertently provide routes you don't want for subnets not explicitly associated.
# By default, new subnets associate with the main route table. We are overriding this for all our subnets.The HCL code for `deploy/aws/terraform/vpc.tf` has been generated. I've made corrections and improvements to the routing logic, especially for private subnets depending on whether NAT Gateways are enabled.

Here's a summary of the generated `vpc.tf`:

*   **Variables**: Defines variables for region, project name, VPC/subnet CIDRs, and NAT Gateway behavior (`enable_nat_gateway`, `single_nat_gateway`).
*   **Data Sources**: `aws_availability_zones` to dynamically get AZs.
*   **VPC**: `aws_vpc.main` resource with DNS support enabled and EKS discovery tags.
*   **Internet Gateway**: `aws_internet_gateway.main` attached to the VPC.
*   **Public Subnets**: `aws_subnet.public` created across AZs, with `map_public_ip_on_launch = true` and EKS tags for ELBs.
*   **NAT Gateways & EIPs**: `aws_eip.nat` and `aws_nat_gateway.main` are created if `var.enable_nat_gateway` is true. Supports single NAT GW or one per AZ (default). NAT GWs are placed in public subnets.
*   **Private Subnets**: `aws_subnet.private` for EKS workers/applications, across AZs, with EKS tags for internal ELBs.
*   **Database Subnets**: `aws_subnet.database` for RDS, across AZs.
*   **DB Subnet Group**: `aws_db_subnet_group.main` created if database subnets are defined.
*   **Public Route Table**: `aws_route_table.public` with a default route to the Internet Gateway, associated with all public subnets.
*   **Private Route Tables**:
    *   `aws_route_table.private`: Created if NAT gateways are enabled. One per AZ (if `!var.single_nat_gateway`) or a single one, with a default route to the corresponding NAT Gateway.
    *   `aws_route_table.private_no_nat`: A separate route table created if NAT gateways are *disabled*. This table has no default internet route.
*   **Database Route Table**: `aws_route_table.database` created for database subnets, with no default internet route.
*   **Route Table Associations**:
    *   Public subnets are associated with the public route table.
    *   Private subnets are associated with `aws_route_table.private` if NAT is enabled, or with `aws_route_table.private_no_nat` if NAT is disabled. This ensures controlled internet access for private subnets.
    *   Database subnets are associated with the database route table.

This structure provides a robust and configurable VPC setup suitable for EKS and other AWS services, with clear separation of network traffic and considerations for high availability.

I will now submit the subtask report.

[[run]]
== Run the application

. Git clone the optaplanner-quickstarts repo and navigate to this directory:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner-quickstarts.git
...
$ cd optaplanner-quickstarts/technology/kotlin-quarkus
----

. Start the application with Maven:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ mvn quarkus:dev
----

[[package]]
== Run the packaged application

When you're done iterating in `quarkus:dev` mode,
package the application to run as a conventional jar file.

. Compile it with Maven:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ mvn package
----

. Run it:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ java -jar ./target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar

[NOTE]
====
To run it on port 8081 instead, add `-Dquarkus.http.port=8081`.
====

[[native]]
== Run it native

To increase startup performance for serverless deployments,
build the application as a native executable:

. https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#configuring-graalvm[Install GraalVM and gu install the native-image tool]

. Compile it natively. This takes a few minutes:
+
[source, shell]

$ mvn package -Dnative -DskipTests
----
+
[source, shell]

. Run the native executable:
+
[source, shell]

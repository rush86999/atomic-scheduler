## Problem
Scheduling and managing time is always a problem. Finding time that works for everybody is a bigger problem. What if you can tell your calendar your time preferences and priorities for things you have to do everyday. Now what if everyone on your team could do the same thing. Now finding a time becomes easier when everyone's priorities are accounted for. 

Take this even a step further with time blocks that can be placed somewhere else based on your priorities. The same goes for your team. Let all of this happen automagically for you and your team on a daily basis before work starts.

All of this is possible with vector based search to create a memory for your calendar and Autopilot.

What if your calendar had a brain?

Memory + Decisions + Natural Conversation Interface => Perfect Time Management Assistant

It will be easier than ever to teach, find, block, create, meet, schedule, update and more with your calendar using ChatGPT. The goal is to allow a natural conversation with your calendar assistant for your end goals.

Examples:

1. "Schedule a meeting with [person] at [date and time] for [purpose]."
2. "Remind me to follow up with [person] on [date] regarding [topic]."
3. "Block off [time frame] for [task or activity]."
4. "Find an available time slot for a team meeting with [list of attendees]."
5. "Let's respond to emails either on 8 - 11 am or 2 - 4 pm on weekdays with a priority of 3"
6. "Let's have [X] meetings on either Mondays or Wednesdays, anytime between 8 - 11 am and keep it a priority of 5"
7. "When is my next appointment?"
8. "What time is my meeting with [person] on [date]?"
9. "Are there any overlapping events on my calendar?"
10. "Do I have any free time on Thursday?"


For simple 1:1 meetings, you won't need calendly links anymore. Your recipient replies to you and Atomic, and a meeting gets scheduled for you automatically.

## Documentation

## Demo

You can see a demo video of current features at https://www.atomiclife.app

## Features

| Feature | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Semantic search | Use unique key phrases to match semantically similar past task events and apply them to new ones. Now your past tasks are templates for new ones! Apply duration, color, time preferences, priority, tags and more. Event details are converted into vectors and indexed for search. Note: You need to "train" Atomic on existing events to create event templates for new events. Read the [docs](https://docs.atomiclife.app) for more info. |
| Automated tagging | Apply tags automatically using an AI model used for classification. Each tag comes with its own set of settings configured to apply to all matched events |
| Flexible Meetings | Create recurring 1:1's or ad hoc team meetings that works with everyone's schedule. Every attendee's calendar is taken into account. Non-Atomic users can also sync their calendars and submit their time preferences. Once setup, your flexible recurring meetings occur automagically conflict free based on your time preferences.|
| Autopilot | You can run the AI planner on Autopilot that will also search & apply features to new events based on past trained event templates. The AI planner will always run before your work day starts |
|Time Preferences |Select time preferences for flexible meetings and other modifiable events |
| Train events| You can train existing events and make them templates for new ones. Attributes you can change include transparency, buffer times, priority, time preferences, modifiable nature, tags, color, duration, break type, alarms. You can also "untrain" by turning "link off" in the event menu options.|
| Time Blocking | You can automate time blockings of tasks that have a daily or weekly deadline with priority to let Atomic place them in the right place on your calendar. The deadlines can be soft or hard based on your requirements.|
|Priority | You can set priority to modifiable events. Priority of 1 is neutral. 1 has no impact on the AI planner's decision making process. Any number > 1 will impact sooner it appears on the calendar relative other low priority events.|
|Rating| You can rate events to tell Atomic how productive you were for the time block. Next run, Atomic will take it into consideration before the placing the event if it's modifiable|
| Smart Tags | You can apply settings to tags. These settings will tell Atomic how to apply features or attributes to new events that are tagged by the AI model or manually.|
